# ToolboxFortran
This repo contains numerical routines written in Fortran. I draw from a number of sources and give proper acknoledgments. If you see that something is not cited properly, please let me know and I will rectify the situation immediately

Some of the programs use a toolbox that accompanies the excellent textbook Fehr and Kindermann (2018), Introduction to Computational Economics Using Fortran, Oxford University Press. Fehr and Kindermann's toolbox is available here: https://github.com/fabiankindermann/ce-fortran/
